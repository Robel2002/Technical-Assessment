## Bug in Create Password Method:
**Description**: I noticed that the createPassword method allows the creation of passwords without essential fields password and username, potentially leading to issues with user authentication.
**Steps to Reproduce**:
I called the createPassword method with a new password object that lacks the password or username field.
I checked if the password was added successfully without the required fields.
**Expected Behavior**: The createPassword method should require both newPassword.password and newPassword.username fields before creating a password.
**Actual Behavior**: The createPassword method allows the creation of passwords without mandatory fields.
**File and Line Number:** passwords.component.ts:21-25
**Fix**: I need to add validation checks to ensure both newPassword.password and newPassword.username are present before creating a password.

## Bug in Update Password Method:
**Description**: I noticed that the updatePassword method does not persistently update passwords in both memory and the JSON file.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
I called the updatePassword method to update an existing password.
I checked if the updated password persists in both memory and the JSON file.
**Expected Behavior**: The updatePassword method should persistently update passwords in both memory and the JSON file.
**Actual Behavior**: The updatePassword method does not consistently update passwords.
**File and Line Number**: passwords.component.ts:28-35
**Fix**: I need to modify the updatePassword method to ensure persistent updates in both memory and the JSON file.

## Bug in deletePassword Method:
**Description**: I observed that the deletePassword method does not remove passwords persistently from both memory and the JSON file.
**Steps to Reproduce**:
I called the deletePassword method to delete an existing password.
I checked if the password is removed persistently from both memory and the JSON file.
**Expected Behavior**: The deletePassword method should remove passwords persistently from both memory and the JSON file.
**Actual Behavior**: The deletePassword method does not consistently remove passwords.
**File and Line Number**: passwords.component.ts:38-43
**Fix**: I need to revise the deletePassword method to ensure persistent removal of passwords from both memory and the JSON file.



## Bug in GetPassword Method:
**Description**: I encountered a bug in the getPasswords route handler where the query object had only two variables, "website" and "id," missing the "username." This caused issues with filtering in the database method.
**Steps to Reproduce**:
Send a GET request to the "/passwords" endpoint without providing the "username" query parameter.
Check if the passwords returned are correctly filtered based on the provided query parameters.
**Expected Behavior**: The getPasswords method should return filtered passwords based on the provided query parameters, including "username."
**Actual Behavior**: The getPasswords method does not handle the "username" query parameter, leading to incorrect filtering.
**File and Line Number**: passwords.routehandler.ts:17-23
**Fix**: Update the query parameters in the getPasswords route handler to include "username" for proper filtering.
